The camera \"sees\" from the lense of the camera model, not the center of the viewport. From top to bottom, left to right, each camera function works as follows: Lock -- This toggle locks the camera in the world, allowing it to operate independantly of your controller. This way you can use both the camera and the controller menu at the same time. Focus -- This value indicates the distance that objects will remain in focus. FOV -- is the Field of View of the camera. It essentially acts as the Zoom. Flip -- This button toggles between regular mode and \"selfie\" mode, rotating the camera to face either direction. Viewport -- This is the main viewport which shows what is being captured on camera. Storyboard -- This button opens the storyboard editor. Capture -- This button takes a picture and saves it to the Image Output folder. Settings -- This button toggles the camera settings menu. Camera Settings From top to bottom, each option changes a different property of the camera. Lense Preset -- This dropdown menu displays different FOV settings based on real-world camera lenses. Resolution -- This selector changes the resolution of the outputted images up to 8K* Anti-Aliasing -- This selector changes the anti-aliasing level of the outputted images. Auto Focus Toggle -- This toggles auto-focus on and off. When off, focus is controlled by moving the left thumbstick/touchpad left or right. Letterbox Toggle -- This toggles a letterbox effect around the Camera UI. This is an aesthetic choice within the editor only. Bloom -- This slider controls the level of bloom in the camera viewport. 8K output is an experimental feature. This is not reccomended for most users because it is extremely taxing on the computer, and will cause lag/stuttering on most systems.","title":"The Camera"},{"location":"cameras/#the-camera-panel","text":"To toggle the camera, press the (Y) button on your VR controller.

This allows the software to use Inverse Kinematics (IK) for easy posing of rigged characters. When configuring rigged characters in the scene, there are two options: Humanoid Rigs Humanoid character rigs are read by finding bones named one of the following: \"head\", \"foot\", \"hand\". The IK rig is then created, allowing the user to pose the model as needed by grabbing those bones (See \"Posing Characters\" below). Non-Humanoid Rigs Non-Humanoid character rigs are read by finding the end \"leaf\" bones of each extremity. This can be used for any type of rigged model including animals. Additionally, this mode is also useful if your humanoid model does not have a properly named skeleton hierarchy. An example of this is as follows: \u251c\u2500 Character Root Bone/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 Left Arm \u2502 \u2514\u2500 Left Upper Arm \u2502 \u2514\u2500 Left Forearm \u2502 \u2514\u2500 Left Hand --- This is the \"Leaf\" bone that will be used. Because it has the word \"hand\", it will be used for both Humanoid and Non-Humanoid rigs. Posing Characters To pose characters, grab and manipulate the IK indicator orbs. The positions of these markers are saved in the .VPS file, and will persist between sessions, just like everything else in the scene.","title":"Rigged Characters"},{"location":"characters/#humanoid-rigs","text":"Humanoid character rigs are read by finding bones named one of the following: \"head\", \"foot\", \"hand\".

You can use the pointer on your right controller to point, and the right trigger to click. Next, choose a name and for the project (below) using the VR keyboard now enabled. Next, choose a location using the file browser. When creating a project with Sceneforge, the software will automatically generate the required file structure in your specified directory. When opening a project, Sceneforge will check if the file structure is correct, and will fix/add any incorrect folders. \u251c\u2500 Project Root Folder/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 3D Models --- Place all 3D Model files here. \u2502 \u2514\u2500 Audio --- Place all audio files here. \u2502 \u2514\u2500 Image Output --- This is where all taken photos are exported. \u2502 \u2514\u2500 Scenes --- This is where all scenes are stored \u2502 \u2514\u2500 Scripts --- This is where all scripts are stored. \u2502 \u2514\u2500 Storyboards --- This is where all storyboards are exported. \u2502 \u2514\u2500 Textures --- This is where all temporary files are stored. \u2502 \u2514\u2500 Video Output --- This is where all taken videos are stored. \u2502 \u2514\u2500 [PROJECT NAME].vps --- This is the actual project file.

Next, navigate to the location of your .vps file using the file browser (pictured above). Importing Custom Assets To import custom art assets, simply drag the file(s) to their respective folders in the project directory. SceneForge Studio accepts different file types for different types of assets: For 3D Models, Sceneforge uses the GLTF format. It accepts .glb files and .gltf files. It will also read .zip archives containing those formats and their textures. For textures, at the moment SceneForge accepts only .png files. This ensures compatability across all uses of images in a project, including skyboxes and backdrop textures.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"gettingStarted/#getting-started","text":"","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"gettingStarted/#creating-a-project","text":"To create a project, select the New Project option in the main menu (pictured below).

The toolbar displays the project name, as well as several functions for the project. Many of these options are self explanatory. Scripting is a feature coming in future releases, and Refresh Project reloads the database of objects and textures, allowing for importing new assets while the application is running. This will cause the VR display to fade to black for a moment, allowing all the new assets to be loaded in without dropping frames. Navigating the Scene To move around the scene, you have three options. You can physically walk around your designated play area. Hold both grip buttons (or grab on Valve Index) and and manipulate the scene around you. Hold the left trigger to show a teleport indicator. Release the trigger to teleport to the chosen spot. Manipulating Objects Your right controller has a pointer that can interact with UI and objects. To interact with an object, click the right trigger while pointing at at either a UI panel or object in the scene. When you click an object, it becomes highlighted. Click the object again to unhighlight it. A selected object displays a bounding box around the object. Additionally, a Movement Gizmo appears at the pointer's location. Click and drag this gizmo to move the object around the scene. Use the Right Joystick or Touchpad to rotate the object left and right, as well as move it forward and back. To toggle scale mode (as indicated by the small Transform Gizmo on the right controller), press the (B) button on your right controller. This button varies depending on what controllers you are using, but they are largely the same. The Controller Menu Your Left Controller has a menu pallette that can bring up other context-sensitive menus. From top to bottom, each button changes what menu is displayed to the right (see below). For a detailed overview of each menu, see section below. Properties -- This menu shoes either the scene hierarchy or any properties of the selected object. Objects -- This menu displays a grid of available objects including standard assets and imported assets. Select an item to spawn it into the scene. Lighting -- This menu has many functions to change the lighting of the scene (see below). Settings -- This menu has many functions relating to the opened project and Sceneforge as a whole (see below). Object Properties Panel This panel will show either the scene hierarchy or object properties depending on if/what object is selected. Every object, when selected (except backdrops), brings up this default toolbar. These functions delete the object, reset the rotation of the object, or toggle interactability. (Whether or not the object can be grabbed with the grip button. This is not recommended for larger objects.) In the example below, there will either be a list of objects in the scene (left; there aren't any objects yet) or options specific to the type of object (right; a light is selected). Object Spawn Menu This panel will display a list of available objects to spawn into the scene. This list includes custom imported objects, and objects that are included with the software. In the future there will also be options to spawn in effects (weather, etc). To spawn in an object, just point and click on one of the tiles. The object will spawn in front of you, and will be added to the scene hierarchy Lighting Menu Panel This panel will display a list of all available skyboxes for the scene. Select a skybox to assign it to the scene. The ambient lighting of the scene will also change to reflect the skybox. At the top of the panel, the add light button will spawn a light in front of you.
