This allows the software to use Inverse Kinematics (IK) for easy posing of rigged characters. When configuring rigged characters in the scene, there are two options: Humanoid Rigs Humanoid character rigs are read by finding bones named one of the following: \"head\", \"foot\", \"hand\". The IK rig is then created, allowing the user to pose the model as needed by grabbing those bones (See \"Posing Characters\" below). Non-Humanoid Rigs Non-Humanoid character rigs are read by finding the end \"leaf\" bones of each extremity. This can be used for any type of rigged model including animals. Additionally, this mode is also useful if your humanoid model does not have a properly named skeleton hierarchy. An example of this is as follows: \u251c\u2500 Character Root Bone/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 Left Arm \u2502 \u2514\u2500 Left Upper Arm \u2502 \u2514\u2500 Left Forearm \u2502 \u2514\u2500 Left Hand --- This is the \"Leaf\" bone that will be used. Because it has the word \"hand\", it will be used for both Humanoid and Non-Humanoid rigs. Posing Characters To pose characters, grab and manipulate the IK indicator orbs.

Importing Custom Assets To import custom art assets, simply drag the file(s) to their respective folders in the project directory.

It will also read .zip archives containing those formats and their textures. For textures, at the moment SceneForge accepts only .png files. This ensures compatability across all uses of images in a project, including skyboxes and backdrop textures. For Skyboxes, SceneForge accepts only .png files.

The toolbar displays the project name, as well as several functions for the project. Many of these options are self explanatory. A few notable options: Refresh Project reloads the database of objects and textures, allowing for importing new assets while the application is running. This will cause the VR display to fade to black for a moment, allowing all the new assets to be loaded in without dropping frames. Reveal Project opens a Windows Explorer window at the project directory. Scripting is a feature coming in future releases. After the scene is finished loading, there is also an option for camera smoothing. This adds smoothing to the desktop view camera. It has no affect in VR, but might affect performance. Navigating the Scene To move around the scene, you have three options. You can physically walk around your designated play area. Hold both grip buttons (or grab on Valve Index) and and manipulate the scene around you. Hold the left trigger to show a teleport indicator. Release the trigger to teleport to the chosen spot. Manipulating Objects Your right controller has a pointer that can interact with UI and objects. To interact with an object, click the right trigger while pointing at at either a UI panel or object in the scene. When you click an object, it becomes highlighted. Click the object again to unhighlight it. A selected object displays a bounding box around the object. Additionally, a Movement Gizmo appears at the pointer's location. Click and drag this gizmo to move the object around the scene. Use the Right Joystick or Touchpad to rotate the object left and right, as well as move it forward and back. To toggle scale mode (as indicated by the small Transform Gizmo on the right controller), press the (B) button on your right controller. This button varies depending on what controllers you are using, but they are largely the same. The Controller Menu Your Left Controller has a menu pallette that can bring up other context-sensitive menus. From top to bottom, each button changes what menu is displayed to the right (see below). For a detailed overview of each menu, see section below. Properties -- This menu shows either the scene hierarchy or any properties of the selected object. Objects -- This menu displays a grid of available objects including standard assets and imported assets. Select an item to spawn it into the scene. Lighting -- This menu has many functions to change the lighting of the scene (see below). Settings -- This menu has many functions relating to the opened project and Sceneforge as a whole (see below). Object Properties Panel This panel will show either the scene hierarchy or object properties depending on if/what object is selected. Every object, when selected (except backdrops), brings up this default toolbar. These functions delete the object, reset the rotation of the object, or toggle interactability. (Whether or not the object can be grabbed with the grip button. This is not recommended for larger objects.) In the example below, there will either be a list of objects in the scene (left; there aren't any objects yet) or options specific to the type of object (right; a light is selected). Object Spawn Menu This panel will display a list of available objects to spawn into the scene. This list includes custom imported objects, and objects that are included with the software. In the future there will also be options to spawn in effects (weather, etc). To spawn in an object, just point and click on one of the tiles.

The storyboard editor is made up of three panels: * The frame selector * The main editor * The overlay selector On the left is a list of all images captured in this project. These are generated from the Image Output folder, and may take a second to load when the storyboard editor is first opened, causing the VR display to fade to black for a moment.. To refresh these images to include newly taken stills, click the refresh button on the top right of this panel. Doing so will cause the display to fade to black as well. The middle panel is where you will actually set up your storyboard, as well as export it to a 4K image. On the right is a list of overlays. These allow you to add indicators for zoom, pan, tilt, and other camera movements. These are meant to mimic the illustrations of a sketched storyboard. Adding Frames To add frames, simply press the plus button on the middle panel. This will add a new empty frame. To add an image to the frame, highlight it by clicking. A purple bar will appear underneath to indicate that it is currently selected. Next, select an image from the list on the left. That will assign the image to the frame. Click it again to deselect, or click a different frame to switch the selection. Any frame can be changed at any time. To add an overlay, follow those same steps, but selecting an overlay from the right, rather than an image from the left. Exporting a Storyboard To export your storyboard, click the download button on the top right of the middle panel. This might take a second depending on the complexity of your image.
