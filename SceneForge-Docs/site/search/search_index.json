This allows the software to use Inverse Kinematics (IK) for easy posing of rigged characters. No matter what option you choose below, SceneForge will generate IK with three connecting bones, regardless of which limb. For example: When configuring rigged characters in the scene, there are two options: Humanoid Rigs Humanoid character rigs are read by finding bones named one of the following: \"head\", \"foot\", \"hand\". The IK rig is then created, allowing the user to pose the model as needed by grabbing those bones (See \"Posing Characters\" below). Non-Humanoid Rigs Non-Humanoid character rigs are read by finding the end \"leaf\" bones of each extremity. This can be used for any type of rigged model including animals. Additionally, this mode is also useful if your humanoid model does not have a properly named skeleton hierarchy. An example of this is as follows: \u251c\u2500 Character Root Bone/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 Left Arm \u2502 \u2514\u2500 Left Upper Arm \u2502 \u2514\u2500 Left Forearm \u2502 \u2514\u2500 Left Hand --- This is the \"Leaf\" bone that will be used. Because it has the word \"hand\", it will be used for both Humanoid and Non-Humanoid rigs. Posing Characters To pose characters, grab and manipulate the IK indicator orbs. The positions of these markers are saved in the .VPS file, and will persist between sessions, just like everything else in the scene.

The Source Code.zip file does not contain the source code to the application--only the example project, which includes a few 3D Models and textures. Steam/SteamVR must be running when opening the application. Please Note: Sometimes Windows' Threat Detector will falsely label the .exe as a threat. This is simply because of the way the application is zipped into a single executable, rather than a folder of many files. If this does happen, click the Defender notification and \"Allow\" Windows to recognize the file. Additionally, because of the \"Self-Extracting\" (SFX) nature of the application, it might take a second to load after being double clicked. This is normal and will be resolved in future releases. Please note that the downloadable application expires after ten days to limit sharing. If you know anyone who would be interested in testing, or would like to continue using SceneForge, please reach out at MidnightCoffeeInc@Gmail.com . A Note on Application Performance Because SceneForge is a creative application, performance (and subsequently framerate) is dependant on what you build. The more objects/polygons/tris in the scene, the higher the risk of frames dropping. Same goes for lights. A Note on Lighting All lighting in SceneForge is realtime. There are no baked lights in the scene, nor is there the ability to do so at runtime. This ensures that all lights are easily modifiable, an important part of realtime virtual production. Overview Video Creating a Project To create a project, select the New Project option in the main menu (pictured below). You can use the pointer on your right controller to point, and the right trigger to click. Next, choose a name and for the project (below) using the VR keyboard now enabled. Next, choose a location using the file browser. When creating a project with Sceneforge, the software will automatically generate the required file structure in your specified directory. When opening a project, Sceneforge will check if the file structure is correct, and will fix/add any incorrect folders. \u251c\u2500 Project Root Folder/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 3D Models --- Place all 3D Model files here. \u2502 \u2514\u2500 Textures --- Place all .PNG textures here. \u2502 \u2514\u2500 360 Images --- Place all .PNG 360 Degree/Pano images here. \u2502 \u2514\u2500 Audio --- Place all audio files here. \u2502 \u2514\u2500 Image Output --- This is where all taken photos are exported. \u2502 \u2514\u2500 Scenes --- This is where all scenes are stored \u2502 \u2514\u2500 Scripts --- This is where all scripts are stored. \u2502 \u2514\u2500 Storyboards --- This is where all storyboards are exported. \u2502 \u2514\u2500 Video Output --- This is where all taken videos are stored. \u2502 \u2514\u2500 [PROJECT NAME].vps --- This is the actual project file. Opening an Existing Project To Open an existing project, select the Open Project option in the main menu (pictured above). Next, navigate to the location of your .vps file using the file browser (pictured above). After loading, you will be taken to your loaded scene. Importing Custom Assets To import custom art assets, simply drag the file(s) to their respective folders in the project directory. SceneForge Studio accepts different file types for different types of assets: For 3D Models, Sceneforge uses the glTF format. It accepts .glB files and .glTF files. It will also read .zip archives containing those formats and their textures. (Recommended) For textures, at the moment SceneForge accepts only .png files. This ensures compatability across all uses of images in a project, including skyboxes and backdrop textures. For Skyboxes, SceneForge accepts only .png files. In order for the scene to display skies correctly, the image should be in the equirectangular 360 Degree/Panorama image format. More About 3D Models At the moment, the glTF model importer only supports triangle meshes (i.e. mesh type = TRIANGLE), whereas the glTF format allows lines (i.e. mesh type = LINES) and point clouds (i.e. mesh type = POINTS). In the future, we hope to support those as well. To check if a glTF file contains unsupported LINES/POINTS meshes, you can use the inspect command in the gltf-transform command line tools. Any 3D model (.FBX, .OBJ, etc) can be converted into .glTF via online tools like this one. glTF models can also be downloaded from a variety of sources, such as SketchFab.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"gettingStarted/#getting-started","text":"","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"gettingStarted/#download-the-sceneforge-alpha","text":"Download the latest .exe from the Github repo (under Releases) You can also download the Source Code.zip which contains a simple example project.

The toolbar displays the project name, as well as several functions for the project. Many of these options are self explanatory. A few notable options: Refresh Project reloads the database of objects and textures, allowing for importing new assets while the application is running. This will cause the VR display to fade to black for a moment, allowing all the new assets to be loaded in without dropping frames. Reveal Project opens a Windows Explorer window at the project directory. Scripting is a feature coming in future releases. After the scene is finished loading, there is also an option for `Camera Smoothing. This adds smoothing to the desktop view camera. It has no affect in VR, but might affect performance. When the camera is activated, there is an option for Mobile Cam . This enables the mobile app functionality that isn't available just yet. Navigating the Scene To move around the scene, you have three options. You can physically walk around your designated play area. Hold both grip buttons (or grab on Valve Index) and and manipulate the scene around you. Hold the left trigger to show a teleport indicator. Release the trigger to teleport to the chosen spot. Manipulating Objects Your right controller has a pointer that can interact with UI and objects. To interact with an object, click the right trigger while pointing at at either a UI panel or object in the scene. When you click an object, it becomes highlighted. Click the object again to unhighlight it. A selected object displays a bounding box around the object. Additionally, a Movement Gizmo appears at the pointer's location. Click and drag this gizmo to move the object around the scene. Use the Right Joystick or Touchpad to rotate the object left and right, as well as move it forward and back. To toggle scale mode (as indicated by the small Transform Gizmo on the right controller), press the (B) button on your right controller. This button varies depending on what controllers you are using, but they are largely the same. The Controller Menu Your Left Controller has a menu pallette that can bring up other context-sensitive menus. From top to bottom, each button changes what menu is displayed to the right (see below). For a detailed overview of each menu, see section below. Properties -- This menu shows either the scene hierarchy or any properties of the selected object. Objects -- This menu displays a grid of available objects including standard assets and imported assets. Select an item to spawn it into the scene. Lighting -- This menu has many functions to change the lighting of the scene (see below). Settings -- This menu has many functions relating to the opened project and Sceneforge as a whole (see below). Object Properties Panel This panel will show either the scene hierarchy or object properties depending on if/what object is selected. Every object, when selected (except backdrops), brings up this default toolbar. These functions delete the object, reset the rotation of the object, or toggle interactability. (Whether or not the object can be grabbed with the grip button. This is not recommended for larger objects.) In the example below, there will either be a list of objects in the scene (left; there aren't any objects yet) or options specific to the type of object (right; a light is selected). Backdrop Selector Panel If you select the backdrop with the pointer, it will highlight and the properties panel will change to a backdrop selector panel. Here you can choose from a grid of textures to apply to the backdrop. These textures are taken from the Textures folder in your project. See Getting Started page for more info about custom assets. Object Spawn Menu This panel will display a list of available objects to spawn into the scene. This list includes custom imported objects, and objects that are included with the software. In the future there will also be options to spawn in effects (weather, etc). To spawn in an object, just point and click on one of the tiles. The object will spawn in front of you, and will be added to the scene hierarchy Lighting Menu Panel This panel will display a list of all available skyboxes for the scene. Select a skybox to assign it to the scene. The ambient lighting of the scene may also change to reflect the skybox. At the top of the panel, the add light button will spawn a light in front of you.

Introduction To open the Storyboard Editor, click the storyboard button on the camera panel. The storyboard editor is made up of three panels: * The frame selector * The main editor * The overlay selector On the left is a list of all images captured in this project. These are generated from the Image Output folder, and may take a second to load when the storyboard editor is first opened, causing the VR display to fade to black for a moment.. To refresh these images to include newly taken stills, click the refresh button on the top right of this panel. Doing so will cause the display to fade to black as well. The middle panel is where you will actually set up your storyboard, as well as export it to a 4K image. On the right is a list of overlays. These allow you to add indicators for zoom, pan, tilt, and other camera movements. These are meant to mimic the illustrations of a sketched storyboard. Adding Frames To add frames, simply press the plus button on the middle panel. This will add a new empty frame. To add an image to the frame, highlight it by clicking. A purple bar will appear underneath to indicate that it is currently selected. Next, select an image from the list on the left. That will assign the image to the frame. Click it again to deselect, or click a different frame to switch the selection. Any frame can be changed at any time. To add an overlay, follow those same steps, but selecting an overlay from the right, rather than an image from the left. Exporting a Storyboard To export your storyboard, click the download button on the top right of the middle panel. This might take a second depending on the complexity of your image. It then outputs a 4K resolution image to the Storyboard folder in your project. That image can then be edited in Photoshop, handed off to a production designer, etc.","title":"Storyboards"},{"location":"storyboards/#storyboard-editor","text":"Images Coming Soon!","title":"Storyboard Editor"},{"location":"storyboards/#introduction","text":"To open the Storyboard Editor, click the storyboard button on the camera panel.
