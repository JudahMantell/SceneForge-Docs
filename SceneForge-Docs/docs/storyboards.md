# Storyboard Editor
**Images Coming Soon!**

## Introduction
To open the Storyboard Editor, click the storyboard button on the camera panel.
The storyboard editor is made up of three panels:
* The frame selector
* The main editor
* The overlay selector

On the left is a list of all images captured in this project.  These are generated from the `Image Output` folder, and may take a second to load when the storyboard editor is first opened, causing the VR display to fade to black for a moment.. To refresh these images to include newly taken stills, click the refresh button on the top right of this panel.  Doing so will cause the display to fade to black as well.

The middle panel is where you will actually set up your storyboard, as well as export it to a 4K image. 

On the right is a list of overlays.  These allow you to add indicators for zoom, pan, tilt, and other camera movements.  These are meant to mimic the illustrations of a sketched storyboard.

## Adding Frames
To add frames, simply press the plus button on the middle panel.  This will add a new empty frame.  To add an image to the frame, highlight it by clicking.  A purple bar will appear underneath to indicate that it is currently selected.  Next, select an image from the list on the left.  That will assign the image to the frame. Click it again to deselect, or click a different frame to switch the selection. Any frame can be changed at any time.

To add an overlay, follow those same steps, but selecting an overlay from the right, rather than an image from the left.

## Exporting a Storyboard
To export your storyboard, click the download button on the top right of the middle panel.  This might take a second depending on the complexity of your image.  It then outputs a 4K resolution image to the Storyboard folder in your project.  That image can then be edited in Photoshop, handed off to a production designer, etc.
