This is the world's first all-in-one Virtual Production and Storyboarding software, built from the ground up for Virtual Reality.  It takes the difficult, expensive, and often proprietary Virtual Production technology that big Hollywood movie houses use and wraps it up into an easy-to-use package for the "prosumer" market. 
*It's the iMovie of Virtual Production*, allowing users to build full-scale film sets, rig up lights, record motion capture data, and output up to 8K, all within a custom virtual soundstage. The PC-based software comes with a companion app that turns any mobile device into a compatible, wireless virtual camera, tracked in 3D space, without the need for extra hardware.  
*It's easy enough for the average consumer, but powerful enough for the seasoned professional.*
