## Public Trello Board ##
You can visit our public Trello board [here](https://trello.com/invite/b/ECzOgfjL/dd7642a4b63bac3dbaff27cdf616e8e3/vp-studio-pro-beta-reports "Trello Board Link") to add found bugs, give feedback, and more.

## Bug/Limitation List ##
* Because the alpha is a self-extracting-executable (SFX) to keep things simple, it might take a second to startup after double-clicking the .exe.  Future 1.0 releases will not have this issue.
* When loading an existing scene, object thumbnails fail to load in the hierarchy display. 
* There is an odd issue when selecting an existing light that will cause the light's properties to jump.
* At the moment the point light options are not functional.  They will be in a future release.
* The overlays panel in the Storyboard Editor is empty at the moment.  Options here will be available in a future release.
* Deleting Storyboard frames doesn't work at the moment.
* When exporting a storyboard, highlighted frames still appear highlighted in the exported image.
* When scaling up or down rigged characters, the IK markers don't scale with them, therefore warping the character.
* When pulling the left trigger, the teleport marker isn't visible, but the user will still teleport.  This has been fixed, and the build will be updated shortly.
