## The Camera Panel ##

To toggle the camera, press the (Y) button on your VR controller.

*The camera "sees" from the lense of the camera model, not the center of the viewport.*

** From top to bottom, left to right, each camera function works as follows: **

* Lock -- This toggle locks the camera in the world, allowing it to operate independantly of your controller. This way you can use both the camera and the controller menu at the same time.

* Focus -- This value indicates the distance that objects will remain in focus.

* FOV -- is the Field of View of the camera. It essentially acts as the Zoom.
* Flip -- This button toggles between regular mode and "selfie" mode, rotating the camera to face either direction.

* Viewport -- This is the main viewport which shows what is being captured on camera.

* Storyboard -- This button opens the storyboard editor.

* Capture -- This button takes a picture and saves it to the Image Output folder.

* Settings -- This button toggles the camera settings menu.

## Camera Settings ##


** From top to bottom, each option changes a different property of the camera. **

* Lense Preset -- This dropdown menu displays different FOV settings based on real-world camera lenses.

* Resolution -- This selector changes the resolution of the outputted images up to 8K*

* Anti-Aliasing -- This selector changes the anti-aliasing level of the outputted images.

* Auto Focus Toggle -- This toggles auto-focus on and off. When off, focus is controlled by moving the left thumbstick/touchpad left or right.

* Letterbox Toggle -- This toggles a letterbox effect around the Camera UI. This is an aesthetic choice within the editor only.

* Bloom -- This slider controls the level of [bloom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_(shader_effect) "Wikipedia article on Bloom.") in the camera viewport.

* *8K output is an experimental feature.  This is not reccomended for most users because it is extremely taxing on the computer, and will cause lag/stuttering on most systems.*
