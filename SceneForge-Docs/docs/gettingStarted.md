# Getting Started

## Creating a Project
When creating a project with Sceneforge, the software will automatically generate the required file structure in your specified directory. When opening a project, Sceneforge will check if the file structure is correct, and will fix/add any incorrect folders.

*It is important that you add any assets before opening the project. - See Known Issues.*

```
├─ Project Root Folder/
│  └─ 3D Models          --- Place all 3D Model files here.
│  └─ Audio              --- Place all audio files here.
│  └─ Image Output       --- This is where all taken photos are exported.
│  └─ Scenes             --- This is where all scenes are stored
│  └─ Scripts            --- This is where all scripts are stored.
│  └─ Storyboards        --- This is where all storyboards are exported.
│  └─ Textures           --- This is where all temporary files are stored.
│  └─ Video Output       --- This is where all taken videos are stored.
│  └─ [PROJECT NAME].vps --- This is the actual project file.

## Scene Controls
**To move around the scene, you have three options.**

1. You can physically walk around your designated play area.
2. Hold both grip buttons (or grab on Valve Index) and and manipulate the scene around you.
3. Hold the left trigger to show a teleport indicator.  Release the trigger to teleport to the chosen spot.

** Manipulating Objects**

Your left controller has a pointer that can interact with UI and objects.
To interact with an object, click the left trigger while pointing at at either a UI panel or object in the scene.
When you click an object, it becomes highlighted. Click the object again to unhighlight it.
